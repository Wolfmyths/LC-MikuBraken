# 1.0.1

- Fixed an issue where Miku could not spawn more than once in a session
- Possible fix for Miku getting stuck on geometry near stairwells (Maybe this Braken does this already???)
- The sound Miku_Caught now uses the Braken's main AudioSource object if it didn't already
- Changed the log message when the mod is initialized
- Minor optimizations

# 1.0.0

- Release ^_^
